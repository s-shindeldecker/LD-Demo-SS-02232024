Demo application using Launch Darkly feature flags


The jupyter notebook contains a demonstration of using a Launch Darkly feature flag to rollout a new predictive model.   This demo is a variation on one that I am currently using to showcase Launch Darkly functionality to our data science department.

In this case the predictive models are simple functions.

To get the best use of the demo, toggle the flag on and off, or change/add rules to the flag while the loop is processing so that you can see how fast changes in the UI are reflected in the local server-side rules.
